# Introduction

Fixed pipeline OpenGL test. It is prototype which leads to [another one](https://github.com/dvoraka/pygl-prototype) with programmable pipeline. Not everything is implemented yet and maybe never will be, but it can be fun to play with code.

You can go forward with Up, remove and insert blocks with mouse buttons a and go up with Page up. If you get stuck somewhere, press Page up.


## Run test

You need Python 2.7 to run and it's good to have virtualenv package.

Install dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run:
```
$ ./gltest.py
```

### Controls

Key | Action
---|---
UP | forward
Page UP | fly up
Mouse left | remove block
Mouse right | insert block
+/- | set visibility
L | lines rendering
F | full rendering
